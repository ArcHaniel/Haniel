   <h1 class="Haniel">Archangel Haniel</h1> 
   <p class="Melon">Haniel also known as Hananel, Anael, Hanael or Aniel, is an angel in Jewish lore and angelology, and is often included in lists as being one of the seven archangels.[2] Haniel is generally associated with the planet Venus, and is the archangel of the sephirah Netzach. The name Haniel probably derives from Hebrew hana'ah, "joy," "pleasure" (qualities associated with Venus) + the suffix -el, "God". It is equivalent to the Phoenician name "Hannibal." Haniel is one of the archangels encrypted in the Sigillum Dei Aemeth of Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelly.</p>
